Some of The Most Important SQL Commands:SELECT - extracts data from a databaseUPDATE - updates data in a databaseDELETE - deletes data from a databaseINSERT INTO - inserts new data into a databaseCREATE DATABASE - creates a new databaseALTER DATABASE - modifies a databaseCREATE TABLE - creates a new tableALTER TABLE - modifies a tableDROP TABLE - deletes a tableCREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)DROP INDEX - deletes an indexSQL Aggregate Functions:MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected columnMAX() - returns the largest value within the selected columnCOUNT() - returns the number of rows in a setSUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical columnAVG() - returns the average value of a numerical columnAggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()).Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tablesLEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right tableRIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left tableFULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right tableSo Few Workers Go Home On-time.Select, From, Where, Group By, Having, Order ByThis is not only the order in which these statements must appear in a query but also which ones should not be indented. Every other column like the ones in the select or the AND should all be indented. In SQL, when performing a JOIN operation, the terms "left" and "right" refer to the position of the tables in the FROM and JOIN clauses.Left Table: This is the table that appears first in the FROM clause or, in a series of joins, the table (or the result set of previous joins) that is to the left of the JOIN keyword. Right Table: This is the table that appears immediately after the JOIN keyword. Important Note: The order of columns in the ON clause (e.g., Users.UserID = Posts.UserID or Posts.UserID = Users.UserID) does not determine which table is left or right. It's solely based on the order of tables in the FROM and JOIN clauses.Understanding which table is left or right is crucial when using LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN, as these join types prioritize returning all rows from either the left or right table, respectively, even if no matching rows are found in the other table.The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. If you want to return all columns, without specifying every column name, you can use the SELECT * syntax:The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values. Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values. By using the DISTINCT keyword in a function called COUNT, we can return the number of different countries.Example: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.! SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes). However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes: You can use other operators than the = operator to filter the search.he following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:Operator	Description=	        Equal>	        Greater than	<	        Less than>=	        Greater than or equal	<=	        Less than or equal<>	        Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=BETWEEN	        Between a certain rangeLIKE	        Search for a patternIN	        To specify multiple possible values for a columnThe ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. (ASC|DESC) The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword. For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order alphabetically. To sort the table reverse alphabetically, use the DESC keyword.The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column. This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName.SELECT * FROM CustomersORDER BY Country, CustomerName;The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted ascending by the "Country" and descending by the "CustomerName" column.SELECT * FROM CustomersORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;The WHERE clause can contain one or many AND operators.The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Spain that starts with the letter 'G':SELECT *FROM CustomersWHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%';The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where Country is "Brazil" AND City is "Rio de Janeiro" AND CustomerID is higher than 50:SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE Country = 'Brazil'AND City = 'Rio de Janeiro'AND CustomerID > 50;You can combine the AND and OR operators. The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that starts with a "G" or an "R".Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result. Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value.The WHERE clause can contain one or more OR operators. The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain.SELECT *FROM CustomersWHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain';The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE. The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where either City is "Berlin", CustomerName starts with the letter "G" or Country is "Norway":SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE City = 'Berlin' OR CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR Country = 'Norway';You can combine the AND and OR operators. The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that starts with a "G" or an "R". Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result. Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value:Select all customers that either:are from Spain and starts with either "G", orstarts with the letter "R":SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';The NOT operator is used in combination with other operators to give the opposite result, also called the negative result.In the select statement below we want to return all customers that are NOT from Spain:SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE NOT Country = 'Spain';In the example above, the NOT operator is used in combination with the = operator, but it can be used in combination with other comparison and/or logical operators. See examples below.NOTELIKE Select customers that does not start with the letter 'A':SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%';NOT BETWEEN Select customers with a customerID not between 10 and 60:SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE CustomerID NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 60;NOT IN Select customers that are not from Paris or London:SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE City NOT IN ('Paris', 'London');NOT Greater Than Select customers with a CustomerId not greater than 50:SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE NOT CustomerID > 50;NOT Less Than Select customers with a CustomerID not less than 50:SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE NOT CustomerId < 50;The SQL INSERT INTO StatementThe INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.INSERT INTO SyntaxIt is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:1. Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted:INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);2. If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:INSERT INTO table_nameVALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);INSERT INTO ExampleThe following SQL statement inserts a new record in the "Customers" table:INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');Insert Data Only in Specified ColumnsIt is also possible to only insert data in specific columns.The following SQL statement will insert a new record, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", and "Country" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically):INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');Insert Multiple RowsIt is also possible to insert multiple rows in one statement.To insert multiple rows of data, we use the same INSERT INTO statement, but with multiple values:INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)VALUES('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway'),('Greasy Burger', 'Per Olsen', 'Gateveien 15', 'Sandnes', '4306', 'Norway'),('Tasty Tee', 'Finn Egan', 'Streetroad 19B', 'Liverpool', 'L1 0AA', 'UK');Make sure you separate each set of values with a comma ,.What is a NULL Value? A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value. Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation! How to Test for NULL Values? It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.IS NULL Syntax:SELECT column_namesFROM table_nameWHERE column_name IS NULL;IS NOT NULL Syntax:SELECT column_namesFROM table_nameWHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;The IS NULL OperatorThe IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values). Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.The IS NOT NULL OperatorThe IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values).The SQL UPDATE StatementThe UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table. Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!UPDATE Syntax:UPDATE table_nameSET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...WHERE condition;UPDATE Table: The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city.UPDATE CustomersSET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'WHERE CustomerID = 1;UPDATE Multiple Records: It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated. The following SQL statement will update the ContactName to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico":UPDATE CustomersSET ContactName='Juan'WHERE Country='Mexico';Update Warning! Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!ExampleUPDATE CustomersSET ContactName='Juan';The SQL DELETE Statement: The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table. Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!DELETE SyntaxDELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;Delete All Records: It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:DELETE FROM table_name;The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:DELETE FROM Customers;Delete a TableTo delete the table completely, use the DROP TABLE statement:DROP TABLE Customers;The SQL SELECT TOP Clause: The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return. The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance. Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.LIMIT, FETCH FIRST, TOP PERCENT,SQL Aggregate Functions: An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group. Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT(*)).The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected columnMAX() - returns the largest value within the selected columnCOUNT() - returns the number of rows in a setSUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical columnAVG() - returns the average value of a numerical columnThe SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions:The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column. The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.Set Column Name (Alias): When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will not have a descriptive name. To give the column a descriptive name, use the AS keyword:SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPriceFROM Products;Use MIN() with GROUP BYHere we use the MIN() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the smallest price for each category in the Products table:SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice, CategoryIDFROM ProductsGROUP BY CategoryID;The SQL COUNT() Function: The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion. You can specify a column name instead of the asterix symbol (*). If you specify a column name instead of (*), NULL values will not be counted. You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions. You can ignore duplicates by using the DISTINCT keyword in the COUNT() function. If DISTINCT is specified, rows with the same value for the specified column will be counted as one. Give the counted column a name by using the AS keyword.Use COUNT() with GROUP BY: Here we use the COUNT() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the number of records for each category in the Products table:SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Number of records], CategoryIDFROM ProductsGROUP BY CategoryID;The SQL SUM() Function: The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column. You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions. Give the summarized column a name by using the AS keyword.Use SUM() with GROUP BY: Here we use the SUM() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the Quantity for each OrderID in the OrderDetails table:SELECT OrderID, SUM(Quantity) AS [Total Quantity]FROM OrderDetailsGROUP BY OrderID;SUM() With an Expression: The parameter inside the SUM() function can also be an expression. If we assume that each product in the OrderDetails column costs 10 dollars, we can find the total earnings in dollars by multiply each quantity with 10:SELECT SUM(Quantity * 10)FROM OrderDetails;We can also join the OrderDetails table to the Products table to find the actual amount, instead of assuming it is 10 dollars:SELECT SUM(Price * Quantity)FROM OrderDetailsLEFT JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID;The SQL AVG() Function: The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column. You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions. Give the AVG column a name by using the AS keyword.Higher Than Average: To list all records with a higher price than average, we can use the AVG() function in a sub query:SELECT * FROM ProductsWHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Products);Use AVG() with GROUP BY: Here we use the AVG() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the average price for each category in the Products table:SELECT AVG(Price) AS AveragePrice, CategoryIDFROM ProductsGROUP BY CategoryID;The SQL LIKE Operator: The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple charactersThe underscore sign _ represents one, single characterThe _ Wildcard: The _ wildcard represents a single character. It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.The % Wildcard: The % wildcard represents any number of characters, even zero characters.Starts With: To return records that starts with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the end of the letter or phrase. Tip: You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.Ends With: To return records that ends with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the beginning of the letter or phrase. Tip: You can also combine "starts with" and "ends with".Contains: To return records that contains a specific letter or phrase, add the % both before and after the letter or phrase.Combine Wildcards: Any wildcard, like % and _ , can be used in combination with other wildcards.Without Wildcard: If no wildcard is specified, the phrase has to have an exact match to return a result.SQL Wildcard Characters: A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string. Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.Symbol	Description%	Represents zero or more characters_	Represents a single character[]	Represents any single character within the brackets *^	Represents any character not in the brackets *-	Represents any single character within the specified range *{}	Represents any escaped character *** Not supported in PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.** Supported only in Oracle databases.Using the % Wildcard: The % wildcard represents any number of characters, even zero characters.Using the _ Wildcard: The _ wildcard represents a single character. It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.Using the [] Wildcard: The [] wildcard returns a result if any of the characters inside gets a match.Using the - Wildcard: The - wildcard allows you to specify a range of characters inside the [] wildcard.Combine Wildcards: Any wildcard, like % and _ , can be used in combination with other wildcards.Without Wildcard: If no wildcard is specified, the phrase has to have an exact match to return a result.Microsoft Access Wildcards:Symbol	Description	                          Example*	Represents zero or more characters	bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob?	Represents a single character	h?t finds hot, hat, and hit[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit!	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat-	Represents any single character within the specified range	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt#	Represents any single numeric character	2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295The SQL IN Operator: The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.NOT IN: By using the NOT keyword in front of the IN operator, you return all records that are NOT any of the values in the list.IN (SELECT): You can also use IN with a subquery in the WHERE clause. With a subquery you can return all records from the main query that are present in the result of the subquery.NOT IN (SELECT): The result in the example above returned 74 records, that means that there are 17 customers that haven't placed any orders. Let us check if that is correct, by using the NOT IN operator.The SQL BETWEEN Operator: The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates. The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included.NOT BETWEEN: To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN.BETWEEN with IN: The following SQL statement selects all products with a price between 10 and 20. In addition, the CategoryID must be either 1,2, or 3:SELECT * FROM ProductsWHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20AND CategoryID IN (1,2,3);BETWEEN Text Values: The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName alphabetically between Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni:SELECT * FROM ProductsWHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'ORDER BY ProductName;The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName between Carnarvon Tigers and Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning:SELECT * FROM ProductsWHERE ProductName BETWEEN "Carnarvon Tigers" AND "Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning"ORDER BY ProductName;NOT BETWEEN Text Values: The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName not between Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni:SELECT * FROM ProductsWHERE ProductName NOT BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'ORDER BY ProductName;BETWEEN Dates: The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate between '01-July-1996' and '31-July-1996':SELECT * FROM OrdersWHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #07/01/1996# AND #07/31/1996#;orSELECT * FROM OrdersWHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';SQL Aliases: SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are often used to make column names more readable. An alias only exists for the duration of that query. An alias is created with the AS keyword.AS is Optional: Actually, in most database languages, you can skip the AS keyword and get the same result.Alias for Columns: The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS CustomerFROM Customers;Using Aliases With a Space Character: If you want your alias to contain one or more spaces, like "My Great Products", surround your alias with square brackets or double quotes. Note: Some database systems allows both [] and "", and some only allows one of them.Concatenate Columns: The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS AddressFROM Customers;Note: To get the SQL statement above to work in MySQL use the following:SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS AddressFROM Customers;Note: To get the SQL statement above to work in Oracle use the following:SELECT CustomerName, (Address || ', ' || PostalCode || ' ' || City || ', ' || Country) AS AddressFROM Customers;Alias for Tables: The same rules applies when you want to use an alias for a table. It might seem useless to use aliases on tables, but when you are using more than one table in your queries, it can make the SQL statements shorter.Aliases can be useful when:There are more than one table involved in a queryFunctions are used in the queryColumn names are big or not very readableTwo or more columns are combined togetherSQL JOIN: A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. Different Types of SQL JOINsHere are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tablesLEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right tableRIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left tableFULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right tableINNER JOIN: The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables. Note: The INNER JOIN keyword returns only rows with a match in both tables. Which means that if you have a product with no CategoryID, or with a CategoryID that is not present in the Categories table, that record would not be returned in the result.SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table1INNER JOIN table2ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;Naming the Columns: It is a good practice to include the table name when specifying columns in the SQL statement.SELECT Products.ProductID, Products.ProductName, Categories.CategoryNameFROM ProductsINNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;The example above works without specifying table names, because none of the specified column names are present in both tables. If you try to include CategoryID in the SELECT statement, you will get an error if you do not specify the table name (because CategoryID is present in both tables).JOIN or INNER JOIN: JOIN and INNER JOIN will return the same result. INNER is the default join type for JOIN, so when you write JOIN the parser actually writes INNER JOIN.JOIN Three Tables:SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperNameFROM ((OrdersINNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match. Note: In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.LEFT JOIN SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table1LEFT JOIN table2ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;SQL LEFT JOIN Example: The following SQL statement will select all customers, and any orders they might have:SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderIDFROM CustomersLEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerIDORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;Note: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (Customers), even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match. Note: In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.RIGHT JOIN SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table1RIGHT JOIN table2ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;SQL RIGHT JOIN Example: The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they might have placed:SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstNameFROM OrdersRIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeIDORDER BY Orders.OrderID;Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword: The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records. Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same. Note: FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!FULL OUTER JOIN SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table1FULL OUTER JOIN table2ON table1.column_name = table2.column_nameWHERE condition;SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Example: The following SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders:SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderIDFROM CustomersFULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerIDORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;Note: The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.SQL Self Join: A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.Self Join SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table1 T1, table1 T2WHERE condition;T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.SQL Self Join Example: The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.CityFROM Customers A, Customers BWHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerIDAND A.City = B.CityORDER BY A.City;The SQL UNION Operator: The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements. The UNION operator automatically removes duplicate rows from the result set. Requirements for UNION:Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columnsThe columns must also have similar data typesThe columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same orderNote: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.The SQL UNION ALL Operator: The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements. The UNION ALL operator includes all rows from each statement, including any duplicates. Requirements for UNION ALL:Every SELECT statement within UNION ALL must have the same number of columnsThe columns must also have similar data typesThe columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same orderWhile the UNION operator removes duplicate values by default, the UNION ALL includes duplicate valuesNote: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.The SQL GROUP BY Statement: The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country". The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.GROUP BY SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table_nameWHERE conditionGROUP BY column_name(s)ORDER BY column_name(s);The SQL HAVING Clause: The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.HAVING SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table_nameWHERE conditionGROUP BY column_name(s)HAVING conditionORDER BY column_name(s);The SQL EXISTS Operator: The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery. The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.EXISTS SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table_nameWHERE EXISTS(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);The SQL ANY and ALL Operators: The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.The SQL ANY Operator: The ANY operator:returns a boolean value as a resultreturns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the conditionANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range. Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).ANY SyntaxSELECT column_name(s)FROM table_nameWHERE column_name operator ANY  (SELECT column_name  FROM table_name  WHERE condition);The SQL ALL Operator: The ALL operator:returns a boolean value as a resultreturns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the conditionis used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statementsALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range. Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).ALL Syntax With SELECTSELECT ALL column_name(s)FROM table_nameWHERE condition;ALL Syntax With WHERE or HAVINGSELECT column_name(s)FROM table_nameWHERE column_name operator ALL  (SELECT column_name  FROM table_name  WHERE condition);The SQL SELECT INTO Statement: The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table. The new table will be created with the column-names and types as defined in the old table. You can create new column names using the AS clause.SELECT INTO SyntaxCopy all columns into a new table:SELECT *INTO newtable [IN externaldb]FROM oldtableWHERE condition;Copy only some columns into a new table:SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...INTO newtable [IN externaldb]FROM oldtableWHERE condition;The SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Statement: The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table. The INSERT INTO SELECT statement requires that the data types in source and target tables match. Note: The existing records in the target table are unaffected.INSERT INTO SELECT SyntaxCopy all columns from one table to another table:INSERT INTO table2SELECT * FROM table1WHERE condition;Copy only some columns from one table into another table:INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...FROM table1WHERE condition;The SQL CASE Expression: The CASE expression goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause. If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.CASE SyntaxCASE    WHEN condition1 THEN result1    WHEN condition2 THEN result2    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN    ELSE resultEND;SQL IFNULL(), ISNULL(), COALESCE(), and NVL() Functions:MySQL: The MySQL IFNULL() function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL, or we can use the COALESCE() function.SQL Server: The SQL Server ISNULL() function lets you return an alternative value when an expression is NULL, or we can use the COALESCE() function.MS Access: The MS Access IsNull() function returns TRUE (-1) if the expression is a null value, otherwise FALSE (0).Oracle: The Oracle NVL() function achieves the same result,  or we can use the COALESCE() function.What is a Stored Procedure? A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again. So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it. You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.Stored Procedure SyntaxCREATE PROCEDURE procedure_nameASsql_statementGO;Execute a Stored ProcedureEXEC procedure_name;SQL Comments: Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements. Note: Comments are not supported in Microsoft Access databases!Single Line Comments: Single line comments start with --. Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).Multi-line Comments: Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. Any text between /* and */ will be ignored. To ignore just a part of a statement, also use the /* */ comment.SQL Operators:SQL Arithmetic Operators:Operator Description+	Add-	Subtract*	Multiply/	Divide%	ModuloSQL Bitwise Operators:Operator	Description&	Bitwise AND|	Bitwise OR^	Bitwise exclusive ORSQL Comparison Operators:Operator Description=	Equal to>	Greater than	<	Less than>=	Greater than or equal to	<=	Less than or equal to<>	Not equal toSQL Compound Operators:Operator Description+=	Add equals-=	Subtract equals*=	Multiply equals/=	Divide equals%=	Modulo equals&=	Bitwise AND equals^=	Bitwise exclusive equals|*=	Bitwise OR equalsSQL Logical Operators:Operator	DescriptionALL	TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the conditionAND	TRUE if all the conditions separated by AND is TRUEANY	TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the conditionBETWEEN	TRUE if the operand is within the range of comparisonsEXISTS	TRUE if the subquery returns one or more recordsIN	TRUE if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressionsLIKE	TRUE if the operand matches a patternNOT	Displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUEOR	TRUE if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUESOME	TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the conditionThe SQL CREATE DATABASE Statement: The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database. Tip: Make sure you have admin privilege before creating any database. Once a database is created, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;The SQL DROP DATABASE Statement: The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database. Note: Be careful before dropping a database. Deleting a database will result in loss of complete information stored in the database! Tip: Make sure you have admin privilege before dropping any database. Once a database is dropped, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;The SQL BACKUP DATABASE Statement: The BACKUP DATABASE statement is used in SQL Server to create a full back up of an existing SQL database. Tip: Always back up the database to a different drive than the actual database. Then, if you get a disk crash, you will not lose your backup file along with the database.The SQL BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Statement: A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup. Tip: A differential back up reduces the back up time (since only the changes are backed up).The SQL CREATE TABLE Statement: The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database. The column parameters specify the names of the columns of the table. The datatype parameter specifies the type of data the column can hold (e.g. varchar, integer, date, etc.). Tip: For an overview of the available data types, go to our complete Data Types Reference.SyntaxCREATE TABLE table_name (    column1 datatype,    column2 datatype,    column3 datatype,   ....);Create Table Using Another Table: A copy of an existing table can also be created using CREATE TABLE. The new table gets the same column definitions. All columns or specific columns can be selected. If you create a new table using an existing table, the new table will be filled with the existing values from the old table.The SQL DROP TABLE Statement: The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database. Note: Be careful before dropping a table. Deleting a table will result in loss of complete information stored in the table!SQL TRUNCATE TABLE: The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.SQL ALTER TABLE Statement: The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table. The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.ALTER TABLE - ADD ColumnTo add a column in a table, use the following syntax:ALTER TABLE table_nameADD column_name datatype;ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMNTo delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):ALTER TABLE table_nameDROP COLUMN column_name;ALTER TABLE - RENAME COLUMNTo rename a column in a table, use the following syntax:ALTER TABLE table_nameRENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;To rename a column in a table in SQL Server, use the following syntax:SQL Server:EXEC sp_rename 'table_name.old_name',  'new_name', 'COLUMN';ALTER TABLE - ALTER/MODIFY DATATYPETo change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:SQL Server / MS Access:ALTER TABLE table_nameALTER COLUMN column_name datatype;My SQL / Oracle (prior version 10G):ALTER TABLE table_nameMODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;Oracle 10G and later:ALTER TABLE table_nameMODIFY column_name datatype;SQL Create Constraints: Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.SyntaxCREATE TABLE table_name (    column1 datatype constraint,    column2 datatype constraint,    column3 datatype constraint,    ....);SQL Constraints: SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted. Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL valueUNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are differentPRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a tableFOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tablesCHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific conditionDEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specifiedCREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quicklySQL NOT NULL Constraint: By default, a column can hold NULL values. The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values. This enforces a field to always contain a value, which means that you cannot insert a new record, or update a record without adding a value to this field.SQL UNIQUE Constraint: The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns. A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint. However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint: The PRIMARY KEY constraint is used to uniquely identify each record in a table. Primary keys must contain unique values, and cannot contain NULL values. Each table can have only ONE primary key. The primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns.SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint: The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables. A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table. The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.SQL CHECK Constraint: The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column. If you define a CHECK constraint on a column it will allow only certain values for this column. If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.SQL DEFAULT Constraint: The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column. The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified.SQL CREATE INDEX Statement: The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables. Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries. Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against. Note: The syntax for creating indexes varies among different databases. Therefore: Check the syntax for creating indexes in your database.CREATE INDEX SyntaxCreates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:CREATE INDEX index_nameON table_name (column1, column2, ...);CREATE UNIQUE INDEX SyntaxCreates a unique index on a table. Duplicate values are not allowed:CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_nameON table_name (column1, column2, ...);DROP INDEX Statement: The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.MS Access:DROP INDEX index_name ON table_name;SQL Server:DROP INDEX table_name.index_name;DB2/Oracle:DROP INDEX index_name;MySQL:ALTER TABLE table_nameDROP INDEX index_name;AUTO INCREMENT Field: Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table. Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.SQL Dates: The most difficult part when working with dates is to be sure that the format of the date you are trying to insert, matches the format of the date column in the database. As long as your data contains only the date portion, your queries will work as expected. However, if a time portion is involved, it gets more complicated.SQL Date Data TypesMySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:DATE - format YYYY-MM-DDDATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SSTIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SSYEAR - format YYYY or YYSQL Server comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:DATE - format YYYY-MM-DDDATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SSSMALLDATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SSTIMESTAMP - format: a unique numberNote: The date types are chosen for a column when you create a new table in your database!Note: Two dates can easily be compared if there is no time component involved! Tip: To keep your queries simple and easy to maintain, do not use time-components in your dates, unless you have to!SQL CREATE VIEW Statement: In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement. Note: A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.CREATE VIEW Syntax:CREATE VIEW view_name ASSELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_nameWHERE condition;SQL Updating a View: A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement.SQL CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax:CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name ASSELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_nameWHERE condition;SQL Dropping a View: A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW statement.SQL DROP VIEW Syntax:DROP VIEW view_name;The COALESCE() function returns the first non-null value in a list. COALESCE(preferred source, less preferred source, ... , least preferred source). The first one to return a value will be what wins. from left to right. COALESCE is a null substitution function.SQL Injection: SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database. SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques. SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.SQL in Web Pages: SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True, SQL Injection Based on ""="" is Always True, SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL StatementsUse SQL Parameters for Protection- To protect a web site from SQL injection, you can use SQL parameters.SQL Hosting: If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a database, your web server should have access to a database-system that uses the SQL language. If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans. The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.MS SQL Server: Microsoft's SQL Server is a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic. SQL Server is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.Oracle: Oracle is also a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic. Oracle is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.MySQL: MySQL is also a popular database software for web sites. MySQL is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system. MySQL is an inexpensive alternative to the expensive Microsoft and Oracle solutions.MS Access: When a web site requires only a simple database, Microsoft Access can be a solution. MS Access is not well suited for very high-traffic, and not as powerful as MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.SQL Data Types: Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type. An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data. Note: Data types might have different names in different database. And even if the name is the same, the size and other details may be different! Always check the documentation!MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0): In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.String Data TypesData type	DescriptionCHAR(size)	A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the column length in characters - can be from 0 to 255. Default is 1VARCHAR(size)	A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the maximum string length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535BINARY(size)	Equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the column length in bytes. Default is 1VARBINARY(size)	Equal to VARCHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the maximum column length in bytes.TINYBLOB	For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Max length: 255 bytesTINYTEXT	Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 charactersTEXT(size)	Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytesBLOB(size)	For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Holds up to 65,535 bytes of dataMEDIUMTEXT	Holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 charactersMEDIUMBLOB	For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects).

You can list up to 65535 values in an ENUM list. If a value is inserted that is not in the list, a blank value will be inserted. The values are sorted in the order you enter themSET(val1, val2, val3, ...)	A string object that can have 0 or more values, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 64 values in a SET listNumeric Data TypesData type	DescriptionBIT(size)	A bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in size. The size parameter can hold a value from 1 to 64. The default value for size is 1.TINYINT(size)	A very small integer. Signed range is from -128 to 127. Unsigned range is from 0 to 255. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)BOOL	Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true.BOOLEAN	Equal to BOOLSMALLINT(size)	A small integer.

The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. This syntax is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.17, and it will be removed in future MySQL versionsFLOAT(p)	A floating point number. MySQL uses the p value to determine whether to use FLOAT or DOUBLE for the resulting data type. If p is from 0 to 24, the data type becomes FLOAT(). If p is from 25 to 53, the data type becomes DOUBLE()DOUBLE(size, d)	A normal-size floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameterDOUBLE PRECISION(size, d)DECIMAL(size, d)	An exact fixed-point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. The maximum number for size is 65. The maximum number for d is 30. The default value for size is 10. The default value for d is 0.DEC(size, d)	Equal to DECIMAL(size,d)Note: All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for the column. If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the UNSIGNED attribute to the columnDate and Time Data TypesData type	DescriptionDATE	A date. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. The supported range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'DATETIME(fsp)	A date and time combination. Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.

The supported range is from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC. Automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can be specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in the column definitionTIME(fsp)	A time. Format: hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'YEAR	A year in four-digit format. Values allowed in four-digit format: 1901 to 2155, and 0000.MySQL 8.0 does not support year in two-digit format.MS SQL Server Data Types:String Data TypesData type	Description	Max char length	Storagechar(n)	Fixed-length non-Unicode character data (n must be between 1 and 8000)	8,000	n bytes (uses one byte for each character)varchar(n)	Variable-length non-Unicode character data (n must be between 1 and 8000)	8,000	n bytes + 2 bytesvarchar(max)	Variable-length non-Unicode character data	 	up to 2 GBnchar(n)	Fixed-length Unicode character data (n must be between 1 and 4000)	4,000	 2 * n bytes (uses two bytes for each character)nvarchar(n)	Variable-length Unicode character data (n must be between 1 and 4000)	4,000	2 * n bytes + 2 bytes (uses two bytes for each character)nvarchar(max)	Variable-length Unicode character data	 	up to 2 GBbinary(n)	Fixed-length binary data (n must be between 1 and 8000)	8,000	n bytesvarbinary(n)	Variable-length binary data (n must be between 1 and 8000)	8,000	actual length of data entered + 2 bytesvarbinary(max)	Variable-length binary data	2GBNumeric Data TypesData type	Description	Storagebit	Integer that can be 0, 1, or NULLtinyint	Allows whole numbers from 0 to 255	1 bytesmallint	Allows whole numbers between -32,768 and 32,767	2 bytesint	Allows whole numbers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647	4 bytesbigint	Allows whole numbers between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807	8 bytesdecimal(p,s)	Fixed precision and scale numbers.Allows numbers from -10^38 +1 to 10^38 –1.The p parameter indicates the maximum total number of digits that can be stored (both to the left and to the right of the decimal point). p must be a value from 1 to 38.
